The motivation and purpose behind this project is learning i was given code and had to refactor it and while doing so get a better understanding of how HTML and CSS elements work together and effect each other.
While working on this project I learned new things like how to use GitLab and Github and also ran into issues were understanding how certain blocks of code effect your web page.
But through trail and error i have a better understanding of using both HTML and CSS.
